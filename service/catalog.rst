knowledge on chemical substances in a cost-efficient way. As a freely
available computational tool, it promotes the use of assessment methods
alternative to animals and minimizes unnecessary animal testing without
reducing the safety of human health and environment. It is intended to
be used by governments, chemical industry and other stakeholders. [`more
