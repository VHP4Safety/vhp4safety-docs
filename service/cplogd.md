# cpLogD

<!-- this file is autogenerated. edit cplogd.json instead -->

A model to predict water–octanol distribution coefficient (logD) for chemical compounds. It is a proxy for the lipophilicity which is a major determinant of drug properties and overall suitability of drug candidates.

## Tool integration

- [ ] Utilises the VHP4Safety APIs to ensure that each service is accessible to our proposed interoperability layer.
- [ ] Is annotated according to the semantic interoperability layer concept using defined ontologies.
- [ ] Is containerised for easy deployment in virtual environments of VHP4Safety instances.
- [ ] Has documented scientific and technical background.
- [ ] Is deployed into the VHP4Safety development environment.
- [ ] Is deployed into the VHP4Safety production environment.
- [ ] Is listed in the VHP4Safety discovery services.
- [ ] Is listed in other central repositories like eInfraCentral, bio.tools and TeSS (ELIXIR).
- [ ] Provides legal and ethical statements on how the service can be used.
