# Case Studies and Regulatory Questions

In the VHP4Safety project, three case studies and two regulatory questions attributed to each case study are under research. Below are these case studies and regulatory questions. 

1. Kidney Disease: Disease scenario to study disease and pharmacovigilance. 
- a. What is a safe dose for cisplatin/tacrolimus in patients with respect to chronic kidney disease?
- b. How can we take into account variability in activity/expression of P-gp in patients that underwent a transplantation?

2. Life Course Pesticide Exposure and Neurodegenerative Disease: Life course exposure scenario to study life course exposure and neurodegenerative disease.
- a. Can compound X cause Parkinson's Disease?
- b. Can we identify groups at extra risk to develop Parkinson's Disease after exposure to compound X?

3. Thyroid Mediated Developmental Neurotoxicity: Age and sex scenario to study health effects discriminated by age and sex on thyroid mediated neurodevelopment. 
- a. What information about a substance do we need to give an advice to women in their early pregnancy to decide whether the substance can be used?
- b. Does substance X influence the thyroid-mediated brain development in the fetus resulting in cognitive impairment in children?
