# AOP-Wiki service tutorial
---
The AOP-Wiki service on the VHP4Safety platform consists of the AOP-Wiki SPARQL endpoint and AOP-Wiki SNORQL User Interface (UI). The data is loaded in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, and this service allows the use of SPARQL queries to extract the data in a flexible and reproducible manner. The service can be used through direct interaction in the browser, or from coding environments. This service description will introduce both the user interaction and the access through coding (automation with *i.e.* R or Python). Also, the general framework of the AOP-Wiki RDF will be described.
